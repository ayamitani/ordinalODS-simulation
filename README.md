# Simulation program used in "Applying survey weights to ordinal regression models for improved inference in outcome-dependent samples with ordinal outcomes"

The `simscript_sm_K5.R` file includes the simulation program generated from the stereotype model (SM) with $K=5$ categories and true parameters in `estparam.RData`. The output includes parameter and standard error estimates from SM applied to the
1. Full cohort
3. Outcome-dependent sample (unweighted)
4. Outcome-dependent sample (weighted)

Simulation programs generated from adjacent-cateogry (`simscript_ac_K5.R`), continuation-ratio (`simscript_cr_K5.R`), and cumulative (`simscript_cm_K5.R`) logit models are also available.
