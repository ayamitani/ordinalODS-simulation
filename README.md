# Simulation program used in "Applying survey weights to ordinal regression models for improved inference in outcome-dependent samples with ordinal outcomes"

The `simulation_script_K5.R` file includes the simulation program with $K=5$ categories. The output includes parameter and standard error estimates from Stereotype model (SM), adjacent-category logit model (AC), continuation-ratio logit model (CR), and cumulative logit model (CM) applied to the
1. Full cohort
3. Outcome-dependent sample (unweighted)
4. Outcome-dependent sample (weighted)
